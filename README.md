Institute Computer Network Design

Project Overview
This project presents a complete computer network design for an educational institute, created to demonstrate practical understanding of computer networking concepts, network topology planning, and inter-department connectivity.
The network is designed to support multiple departments, labs, administrative blocks, and remote buildings, ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficient communication across the entire campus.

Objectives

Design a structured and scalable institute network
Ensure inter-department communication
Implement hierarchical network architecture
Apply routing, switching, and subnetting concepts
Provide a network suitable for academic, administrative, and research activities

Network Architecture

The institute network follows a hierarchical design model, consisting of:
Core Layer
Central router(s) connecting different campus blocks
Handles inter-building and WAN connectivity
Distribution Layer
Routers/switches connecting individual departments
Responsible for routing between subnets
Access Layer
Switches connecting end devices such as:
PCs
Servers
Printers
Faculty systems

Network Components Used

Routers – For inter-network and inter-building communication
Switches – To connect devices within departments
End Devices – PCs, servers, printers
Cables & Links – Wired connections between network devices

Campus Layout (As per Design)

The network covers:
Multiple academic departments
Computer laboratories
Administrative block
Library / server section
Remote buildings connected via routers
Each block is logically separated using subnetting while maintaining seamless communication.

IP Addressing & Subnetting

Uses structured IP addressing
Subnetting applied to:
Reduce broadcast traffic
Improve security
Allow easy expansion
Each department is assigned a separate subnet

Security Considerations

Logical separation of departments using subnets
Centralized routing for controlled communication
Scope for implementing:
ACLs
Firewalls
VLANs (future enhancement)

Tools & Technologies

Cisco Packet Tracer (for simulation & design)
Networking concepts:
Routing
Switching
Subnetting
Hierarchical network design

Project Outcomes

Successfully designed a complete institute-level network
Demonstrated practical application of computer network theory
Created a realistic and scalable campus network
Suitable for academic evaluation and viva

Future Enhancements

VLAN implementation for better security
Wireless network integration (Wi-Fi)
Firewall and intrusion detection
Redundant links for fault tolerance
Internet gateway with NAT
